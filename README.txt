This is a game of Tetris, taken from starter code made maintained by Adeel Bhutta and created by Bryce. For the midterm of CS3520 Programming in C++, we had to take existing functionality and add graphics, colors, etc. using the nurses graphics library. 

Here are the features that were created:

Existing Starter code functionality:
- gave existing framework of each of the classes
- no playable game functionality

Game functionality:
- randomizing the pieces, moving the pieces left and right, rotating the pieces
- implemented timer
- created different levels of difficulty (easy, medium, and hard)

Extra bonuses:
- implemented four types of new pieces 
- previewing the next piece to drop
- saving highest scores to files
